# car-database-sql-project
Analyzed a car dataset to extract key insights using SQL. Key tasks included calculating the average selling price for cars with specific attributes, identifying top car models based on mileage, and finding price differences greater than $10,000 between models. The project also involved calculating cumulative selling prices over time and identifying cars with price decreases year-over-year. Utilized advanced SQL techniques such as aggregation, window functions, and subqueries for efficient data analysis and reporting.
